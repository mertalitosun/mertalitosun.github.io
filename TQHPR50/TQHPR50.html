            <p class="one-content">The heart of TQ-Group’s e-bike transmission is the HPR50— short for harmonic pin ring transmission with 50Nm of torque. What’s a harmonic pin ring transmission? It’s a relatively simple, yet ingenious, drive mechanism that operates similarly to a rotary motor, but more refined. Internally, there are three concentric precision pieces, an elliptical wave generator, inner flex spline, and a circular spline, that come together to propel you forward, while remaining small and lightweight. Compared to classic toothed gears and belt drives, a harmonic pin ring transmission is more compact, more powerful, feels smoother, and is more durable.</p>

                    Due to their precision, durability and compact design, harmonic pin ring transmissions and specifically TQ harmonic pin ring drives, have been used in the space industry, aviation, the medical industry, and robotics. For all the same reasons they succeed in moon landers and surgery robots, they work great in e-bikes as well.
